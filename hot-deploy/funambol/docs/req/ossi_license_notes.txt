When you test it internally, before showing to client, please check the headers because you may disagree with my judgement about what header goes where.

Ok, please give me a list of what you may have copied from ofbiz, what 
you may have copied from funambol. 

Also there is a file ADDITIONAL-LICENSE in opentaps-1.0.0/ so if you 
could modify that to point to all your new jars I'd appreciate it.

Sorry but this is pretty important thing. If you copy any portion of 
any file from OFBIZ, you have to include the license header from the 
APACHE2_HEADER file in opentaps-1.0/ and then make a note 

"This file has been modified by XXXXXX" 

You could see this a lot in our components. Please look through the 
apache 2.0 license if you have any questions, Section 4 
"Redistribution," at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html 

And then please put the generic open source strategies HPL header on all 
files.

We can't have anything which uses a framework that we cannot include as 
part of our open source product, so if you want to use your framework 
you'd have to release it under a license compatible with ours at 
opentaps. If you'd like, you can release it under a commercial/open 
source license model--we would not require that you use the Apache/BSD 
license.
