framework/entity/src/org/ofbiz/entity/GenericDelegator.java
r12909 Removed depracation tags for the findXXX methods. Ofbiz deprecated them to be replaced with findOne, findList but the old methods are used in too many places to be refactored
completely for now.

framework/service/config/serviceengine.xml
r12978 Added the POJOJavaEngine as a service engine. This is a needed part of opentaps.

framework/base/config/pojoentities-containers.xml

r13298 Fixed, reverted previous change in RequestHandler.java

framework/entity/src/org/ofbiz/entity/GenericEntity.java

Other API Changes
-----------------

- UtilValidate no longer defines:
 * isDateTime
 * isTimestamp
And UtilDateTime no longer defines:
 * getDateFormat
 * getTimeFormat
 * getDateTimeFormat
 * getJsDateTimeFormat
 * ... and others ...
those are now in org.opentaps.common.util.UtilDate

- UtilDateTime.toCalendar must have a TimeZone set or will throw a NPE. This can be indirect if for example the method s called from a service getting those from the context without checking
if the timezone / locale are actually set. UtilDate.toCalendar handles this case more gracefully by defaulting to the system timezone / locale.
Note: this only affects two services in WorkEffortServices.java : processWorkEffortEventReminders and getWorkEffortEventsByPeriod

- Since the move to generics, UtilMisc.addToBigDecimalInMap is not working for a Map<?, BigDecimal>, instead use UtilCommon.addInMapOfBigDecimal

- ServiceUtil.isSucess was moved to UtilCommon

- The base users (admin, system, ...) and UserLogin seed data is no longer loaded by ofbiz, instead it is loaded as demo data. The needed data was added into CommonSecurityData.xml


Possible buisness logic changes
-------------------------------

hot-deploy/opentaps-common/src/common/org/opentaps/domain/order/OrderItemShipGroup.java
r13023 getEstimatedShipDate is now also a field of the OISG entity, the method now takes this value into account.
If the ship group may split, the calculated date is the earliest of the estimatedShipDate set on the OISG and the promisedDatetime of the related OrderItemShipGrpInvRes.
Else it is the latest of those values.
TODO: see when this value get set and with which value, else we can use it to cache the result of this method or just ignore it and leave it to null.

applications/product/entitydef/entitymodel_old.xml
r13098 remove OldFacilityRole from ofbiz product entitydef
related to this change:
r13098 re-added FacilityRole Entity define in opentaps common.

applications/manufacturing/src/org/ofbiz/manufacturing/routing/RoutingServices.java
r13123 change return parameters estimatedSetupMillis/estimatedMilliSeconds to fix service define (Double -> BigDecimal)
TODO: it should patch back to ofbiz

applications/manufacturing/src/org/ofbiz/manufacturing/jobshopmgt/ProductionRunServices.java
