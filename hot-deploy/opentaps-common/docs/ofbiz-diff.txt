
Framework changes
-----------------

This list the changes made in the framework directory, from the 09.04 ofbiz release.


framework/base/src/org/ofbiz/base/util/UtilFormatOut.java
r12890 Added a formatCurrency method which does not require the maximumFractionDigits argument. It uses the default value for the locale. Added for backward compatibility.

framework/entity/src/org/ofbiz/entity/GenericDelegator.java
r12909 Removed depracation tags for the findXXX methods. Ofbiz deprecated them to be replaced with findOne, findList but the old methods are used in too many places to be refactored
completely for now.

framework/service/config/serviceengine.xml
r12978 Added the POJOJavaEngine as a service engine. This is a needed part of opentaps.


Applications changes
--------------------

This list the changes made in the applications directory, from the 09.04 ofbiz release.

applications/order/servicedef/secas.xml
r12967 removed receiveInventoryProduct service eca

applications/order/src/org/ofbiz/order/shoppingcart/ShoppingCart.java
r12896 made some methods / attributes protected instead of private, so we can access them in OpentapsShoppingCart

applications/order/entitydef/entitymodel_old.xml
r12972 removed OldCustRequestRole from ofbiz order entitydef
related to this change:
r12972 re-added CustRequestRole/InventoryEventPlanned/InventoryEventPlannedType/MrpInventoryEventPlanned in opentaps common.

ofbiz remove contentPurposeEnumId from entity PartyContent, also add partyContentTypeId as part of primary key.
I re-add contentPurposeEnumId in r12982, and going to refactor relate codes. 


Other API Changes
-----------------

- UtilValidate no longer defines:
 * isDateTime
 * isTimestamp
And UtilDateTime no longer defines:
 * getDateFormat
 * getTimeFormat
 * getDateTimeFormat
 * getJsDateTimeFormat
 * ... and others ...
those are now in org.opentaps.common.util.UtilDate

- UtilDateTime.toCalendar must have a TimeZone set or will throw a NPE. This can be indirect if for example the method s called from a service getting those from the context without checking
if the timezone / locale are actually set. UtilDate.toCalendar handles this case more gracefully by defaulting to the system timezone / locale.
Note: this only affects two services in WorkEffortServices.java : processWorkEffortEventReminders and getWorkEffortEventsByPeriod

- Since the move to generics, UtilMisc.addToBigDecimalInMap is not working for a Map<?, BigDecimal>, instead use UtilCommon.addInMapOfBigDecimal

- ServiceUtil.isSucess was moved to UtilCommon
