Applications changes
--------------------

This list the changes made in the applications directory, from the 09.04 ofbiz release.

applications/order/servicedef/secas.xml
r12967 removed receiveInventoryProduct service eca

applications/order/src/org/ofbiz/order/shoppingcart/ShoppingCart.java
r12896 made some methods / attributes protected instead of private, so we can access them in OpentapsShoppingCart

applications/order/entitydef/entitymodel_old.xml
r12972 removed OldCustRequestRole from ofbiz order entitydef
related to this change:
r12972 re-added CustRequestRole/InventoryEventPlanned/InventoryEventPlannedType/MrpInventoryEventPlanned in opentaps common.

ofbiz remove contentPurposeEnumId from entity PartyContent, also add partyContentTypeId as part of primary key.
I re-add contentPurposeEnumId in r12982, and going to refactor relate codes. 

Accounting related:
 * commented out secas_ledger.xml from applications/accounting/ofbiz-component.xml

applications/content/lib/lucene-core-2.4.0.jar
r13032 Upgraded lucene from 2.2 to 2.4 needed for hibernate search.

applications/party/script/org/ofbiz/party/contact/PartyContactMechServices.xml
- fix the createPartyContactMech service to return the contact mech id if it reuses an existing contact mech


applications/accounting/ofbiz-component.xml
- commented out the services, secas and entities related to ofbiz BI (SalesInvoiceItemFact)

applications/accounting/src/org/ofbiz/accounting/invoice/InvoiceServices.java
- fix updatePaymentApplication, it only worked if the payment was fully applied

applications/accounting/data/AccountingTypeData.xml
- The following AcctgTransType were removed from Ofbiz as they already exist in opentaps with slightly different acctgTransTypeId:
 * (exists)             -> (removed)
 * DISBURSEMENT_ACCTG_T -> DISBURSEMENT
 * RECEIPT_ACCTG_TRANS  -> RECEIPT
 * ITEM_VARIANCE_ACCTG_ -> ITEM_VARIANCE
 * MANUFACTURING_ATX    -> MANUFACTURING
 * OTHER_INTERNAL_ACCTG -> OTHER_INTERNAL
 * SALES_ACCTG_TRANS    -> SALES
 

Other API Changes
-----------------

- UtilValidate no longer defines:
 * isDateTime
 * isTimestamp
And UtilDateTime no longer defines:
 * getDateFormat
 * getTimeFormat
 * getDateTimeFormat
 * getJsDateTimeFormat
 * ... and others ...
those are now in org.opentaps.common.util.UtilDate

- UtilDateTime.toCalendar must have a TimeZone set or will throw a NPE. This can be indirect if for example the method s called from a service getting those from the context without checking
if the timezone / locale are actually set. UtilDate.toCalendar handles this case more gracefully by defaulting to the system timezone / locale.
Note: this only affects two services in WorkEffortServices.java : processWorkEffortEventReminders and getWorkEffortEventsByPeriod

- Since the move to generics, UtilMisc.addToBigDecimalInMap is not working for a Map<?, BigDecimal>, instead use UtilCommon.addInMapOfBigDecimal

- ServiceUtil.isSucess was moved to UtilCommon

- The base users (admin, system, ...) and UserLogin seed data is no longer loaded by ofbiz, instead it is loaded as demo data. The needed data was added into CommonSecurityData.xml


Possible buisness logic changes
-------------------------------

hot-deploy/opentaps-common/src/common/org/opentaps/domain/order/OrderItemShipGroup.java
r13023 getEstimatedShipDate is now also a field of the OISG entity, the method now takes this value into account.
If the ship group may split, the calculated date is the earliest of the estimatedShipDate set on the OISG and the promisedDatetime of the related OrderItemShipGrpInvRes.
Else it is the latest of those values.
TODO: see when this value get set and with which value, else we can use it to cache the result of this method or just ignore it and leave it to null.

applications/product/entitydef/entitymodel_old.xml
r13098 remove OldFacilityRole from ofbiz product entitydef
related to this change:
r13098 re-added FacilityRole Entity define in opentaps common.

applications/manufacturing/src/org/ofbiz/manufacturing/routing/RoutingServices.java
r13123 change return parameters estimatedSetupMillis/estimatedMilliSeconds to fix service define (Double -> BigDecimal)
TODO: it should patch back to ofbiz

applications/manufacturing/src/org/ofbiz/manufacturing/jobshopmgt/ProductionRunServices.java
